## 🌐 Adding New Languages

The app uses a simple localization system. To add a new language:

1. Create `src/locales/xx.js` (replace `xx` with language code)
2. Copy all keys from `en.js` and translate values
3. Import in `App.jsx`: `import xxTranslations from './locales/xx.js';`
4. Add to translations object: `xx: xxTranslations`
5. Add option to language selector dropdown

See [LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md](./LOCALIZATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### Available Voice Languages

Text-to-speech supports these languages:
- 🇩🇪 German (de-DE)
- 🇺🇸 English US (en-US)
- 🇬🇧 English UK (en-GB)
- 🇫🇷 French (fr-FR)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish (es-ES)
- 🇮🇹 Italian (it-IT)
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese (pt-PT)
- 🇳🇱 Dutch (nl-NL)
- 🇵🇱 Polish (pl-PL)
- 🇷🇺 Russian (ru-RU)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Timer Settings
Default values can be modified in the "New Game" setup screen:
- **Duration**: 30s, 1min, 1.5min, 2min, 3min, 5min
- **Extensions**: 0-10 per player (30 seconds each)

### Storage
All data is stored in browser localStorage:
- `game-history` - Completed games
- `saved-players` - Player profiles
- `active-game` - Current game state
- `ui-language` - Selected interface language

### Clearing Data
To reset all data:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
```
Then refresh the page.

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
The app uses Tailwind utility classes. To customize:
1. Modify the Tailwind configuration
2. Update classes in `App.jsx`
3. Color scheme uses Indigo/Purple gradient

### Timer Sounds
Sound generation uses Web Audio API. To customize:
- Edit `playTickTock()` for countdown sound
- Edit `playTurnNotification()` for turn change sound

### Clock Design
The analog clock can be customized in the `AnalogClock` component:
- Colors: Lines 518-523 in App.jsx
- Size: `radius` variable
- Tick marks: Lines 524-531

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Browser Compatibility**: Web Speech API may not work in all browsers
- **localStorage Limits**: Most browsers limit to ~5-10MB
- **Offline Only**: No cloud sync (all data stored locally)
- **Large Images**: Player photos are compressed to reduce storage usage
